I don t think there s anything wrong with the Dub. It s honestly not that bad. some of the voices might be meh and the emotion is hit and miss, but I don t think it s all bad.,1
Here’s a pro-tip: never ever watch any show in a dubbed form. Not for any reason, ever. Never will it be better or more true to the writing, and never will it ever be more interesting or compelling.,0
I agree, it s horrendous and hard to understand how it could be this bad. Even the voices don t seem to match the actors to me. How can I see the Spanish subtitled version? I have stopped watching just due to the awful dubbing. ,0
Dubbing is something you have to get used to I guess. I live in a country where everything is dubbed so I grew up with it and I didn t have any problems with it watching the show. I know that OV is always better though and I watch every English TV show in English but with Spanish I wouldn t understand a single word and don t want to be too distracted with the reading.,1
I agree the dubbing was probably easier to do in italian, but I also mean the way the whole thing sounds. In the english version of the series I almost feel like I’m in the studio with the voice actors while I’m watching the scene they’re dubbing. Don’t really know how to explain this.,0
I hate watching non english shows as i dont like to read the sub titles and dubs was terrible, but this damn show was way to good, the dub is trash but the show being so good makes it completely worth it,0
I never understood why people watch dubbed movies. I hate it in my own country, even though we apparently have some of the best voice acting in the non-English parts of the world. Still, it s not the way it s meant to be watched. Learn to fucking read, you re only getting 50 % of the acting.,0
My sister tried to convince me to switch to dubbing halfway through Casa de Papel because it was so much better in English. I watched for two minutes and was like, No. That s not what Nairobi sounds like. I can t do this.,0
This is how I feel about casa de papel- both the translations AND dubbing were terrible. (Especially the dubbing, my god). I watched it all in Spanish and then some in English with my parents and I couldn’t stop cringing.,0
Oh, and La Casa de Papel - that s mind-blowing. Though to properly enjoy it, I had to change the settings to the original Spanish dialogue with English subtitles. The dubbing stripped it of some essential element.,0
